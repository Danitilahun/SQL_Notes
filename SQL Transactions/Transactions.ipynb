    "# Transactions in SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a single unit of work.  Think of it as an \"all-or-nothing\" operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ACID Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactions should adhere to the ACID properties to ensure data integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Atomicity:**  All operations within the transaction are treated as a single, indivisible unit.  Either *all* operations succeed, or *none* of them do.  If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, leaving the database in its original state.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Consistency:** The transaction maintains the integrity of the database.  It ensures that the data remains valid and consistent before and after the transaction is executed.  This typically involves enforcing constraints, rules, and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions should not interfere with each other. Each transaction should appear to execute as if it were the only transaction running on the database at that time. This prevents data corruption and inconsistencies due to overlapping updates.  Different isolation levels exist to trade off isolation with performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed (successfully completed), the changes made by the transaction are permanent and will survive even system failures (e.g., power outages, crashes).  This is typically achieved by writing the changes to a persistent storage medium (like a hard drive) and using transaction logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL provides the following commands to manage transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`BEGIN TRANSACTION` (or `START TRANSACTION`):**  This statement marks the beginning of a new transaction. All subsequent SQL statements will be considered part of this transaction until a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` is issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`COMMIT`:**  This statement saves all the changes made during the transaction to the database.  The transaction is considered successful, and the changes are made permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`ROLLBACK`:**  This statement undoes all the changes made during the transaction. It reverts the database to the state it was in before the transaction began. This is used to handle errors or unexpected conditions that prevent the transaction from completing successfully."
